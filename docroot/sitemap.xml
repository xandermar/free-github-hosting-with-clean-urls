    Oahu&rsquo;s north shore, we spotted a sea turtle swimming about. We learned that sea turtles can live over 100
    years and they&rsquo;re really good at survival in rough environments. Besides being an adorable creature, they
    teach us about calm, cool and collected vibes. As Crush (Disney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Finding Nemo&rdquo; character) would

    she&rsquo;d point at the slogan. The slogan has always inspired Xandermar to do more. Doing more is equally paired
    with enthusiasm. Without enthusiasm, the knowledge may be never utilized or never maximized to its potential.
    Alternatively, we can have all the enthusiasm in the world, but without educating ourselves it doesn&rsquo;t matter.
    For knowledge is the engine that moves the train forward, the key to start the engine will be nothing other than
    enthusiasm.</p><p>We&rsquo;d love to hear from you!
